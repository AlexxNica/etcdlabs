    <h4>How etcd is tested <span class="next-to-header-title">(last update Jan 1, 2017)</span></h4>
    <br>
    <p class="narrow-paragraph">
        Reliability and robustness of etcd is our <b>highest</b> priority. As of December 8, 2016, etcd weighs in at 114,815 lines of Go code. This is only code that could be considered exclusive to etcd; vendored and auto-generated code doesn’t count. Over half the code base, 60,033 lines, is dedicated to tests and testing infrastructure. Since so much of etcd is dedicated to tests, there are many kinds of tests. The testing infrastructure for etcd includes unit tests, integration tests, migration tests, end-to-end tests, benchmarks, regression tests, soak tests, stress tests, and functional tests.
    </p>
    <p class="narrow-paragraph">
        <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/master/tools/functional-tester" target="_blank"
            class="normal-link">functional-tester</a> verifies the correct behavior of etcd under various system and network malfunctions. It sets up an etcd cluster under high pressure loads and continuously injects failures into the cluster. Then it expects the etcd cluster to recover within a short amount of time. This has been extremely helpful<sup>[1]</sup> to find critical bugs, <i>before anyone else</i>; see a list of bugs that it has found at <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Acomponent%2Ffunctional-tester+is%3Aclosed" target="_blank" class="normal-link">GitHub Issues</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="narrow-paragraph">
        The tester ensures that etcd operates as expected during failure and after recovery. So it continuously injects failures to etcd cluster while stressing them with heavy workloads. And then compares database hashes of each node to see if cluster keeps its data consistent. Some of the failures are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kill random node</li>
        <li>Kill leader node</li>
        <li>Kill majority of nodes in cluster</li>
        <li>Kill all nodes</li>
        <li>Kill node for a long time to trigger snapshot when it comes back</li>
        <li>Network partition</li>
        <li>Slow network</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="narrow-paragraph">
        Furthermore, it also performs crash tests, such as power loss, I/O error, partial writes, and so on. It is impractical to run these tests with real power failures. So etcd crash testing is simulated with <a href="https://github.com/coreos/gofail" target="_blank" class="normal-link">gofail</a>. etcd has tons of fail points in its code base, and tester triggers Go runtime panics in etcd. Some of the failures are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>panic before/after database commits an entry</li>
        <li>panic before/after Raft follower sends message</li>
        <li>panic before/after Raft leader sends message</li>
        <li>panic before/after Raft saves entries</li>
        <li>panic before/after Raft saves snapshot</li>
        <li>panic before/after Raft applies entries</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="narrow-paragraph">
        etcd functional-tester runs 24/7; cluster gets about 8,000 failure injections per day, <i>1 failure injection for every 10-second</i>. In 2016, etcd went through more than 1.7 million failure injects.
